# TRANSACTION VIEWING SYSTEM
"Now a day’s people have multiple Bank Accounts and they struggle to view their Transaction details. If a person has a debit, credit card or both of different bank’s he needs more than one application to view the transaction details.
       So we develop a web application to make it easy for the users to view the bank transaction details of different banks. User will register into this application and add his account details. The Admin adds the bank officer of the user’s respective bank. The bank officer verifies the user’s account details. He uploads a CSV format file. When the user requests for transaction details and the view is created on the application.
